This program detects the black line in the picture and calculates the equation of the line of best fit. Afterwards,
the program calculates the standard deviation of the vertical distances of the drawn line and the line of best fit.
The resulting vaue can be used as a rating to compare the neatness, or straightness of two lines drawn on the picture.

This program was written for the Praxis course in the engineering science program. The program was used to compare the 
neatness of two drawings by comparing the said standard deviation. The line with the lower standard deviation is the winner
in the comparison.
